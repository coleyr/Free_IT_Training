Cool, there are loads of great things about professions directly and indirectly associated with IT. The tough thing is knowing where to get started, it is a huge field with so much detail and Jargon and Acronyms. It can be a lot to take in all at once, first piece of advice, take it in chunks and dont be worried if it feels like a lot at times because it is. Second piece of advice is to pick one thing at a time and get to a point to where you can get comfortable with it. Programming in a particular language, get to know the basics, certification, get to know the outline and syllabus. You don't have to become an expert just get comfortable with some of the language around what you are trying to learn. Find some videos of tech personalities discussing the topics. Once you are comfortable, decide whether or not you want to learn this corner of IT. Does it offer a good salary? Is it future proofed? Is it fun to play with? How long will it take? Once you decide to persue spend some cycles finding good learning resources. Video, Step by Step, Books, which one you choose is up to you, me personally I really like video courses, the more hand holding for me the better. Next set up a schedule with a defined start and end date, spread out the learning into managable chunks. If your busy make the chunks small, don't over extend, it will make it more likely you will burnout. Finally don't be afraid to change your mind, if the topic isn't appealing it isn't that you are inadequate some of this stuff is just no fun, do something else start with researching again.</p>"},{"location":"certifications/CCNA/","title":"CCNA","text":""},{"location":"certifications/CCNA/#about","title":"About","text":"<p>CCNA certification CCNA certification proves you have what it takes to navigate the ever-changing landscape of IT.

Rust emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. Rust enforces memory safety\u2014that is, that all references point to valid memory\u2014without requiring the use of a garbage collector or reference counting present in other memory-safe languages. To simultaneously enforce memory safety and prevent concurrent data races, Rust's \"borrow checker\" tracks the object lifetime of all references in a program during compilation. Rust is popular for systems programming but also offers high-level features including some functional programming constructs.</p> <p>Software developer Graydon Hoare created Rust as a personal project while working at Mozilla Research in 2006.

For information about APIs that are specific to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.</p> <p>The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402). As soon as one browser implements a feature, we try to document it.

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface.
